Problem 2 (50pts/40pts):
Your goal is to develop a two-dimensional decomposition of the Game of Life (a cellular automaton created
by Prof. John Conway in 1970) using MPI for inter-process communication (and sequential processing in
each process for the algorithm):
• a 2D decomposition of an NxN world of cells (let space be a dead space and ’*’ is a live space).
Represent cells as ’char’.
• Divide the world as evenly you can among a logical array of P × Q processes.
• For each cell on iteration i, it is alive in iteration i + 1 if it is alive in iteration i, and has two or three
live neighbors.
• For each cell on iteration i, if it is dead on iteration i, then it is alive i + 1 if it has three live neighbors.
• The boundaries of your world wrap, forming a torus. That is, if you go off the left side of the domain,
you come back on the right (and vice versa). If you go off the top, you come back on the bottom (and
vice versa).

Note: You will need two copies of your domain, one for even iterations and one for odd.

The way Life works, each cell has eight neighbors. These eight neighbors define the so-called stencil.
This stencil induces communication between your processes. Around your local domain, you will need the
“halo” (or ghost cells) that come from the eight neighbors. To a process (p, q), there are North, South, East,
West, NW, NE, SW, SE neighbor communications.

Test this with at last eight MPI processes and at least with N = 512. Make sure it works correctly even
when P = 1 and/or Q = 1 (which means there is no communication in one dimension or the other, just local
wrapping of boundaries).

Notes:
• We will go over lots of the details in class of how to manage the local data structures and halos to help.
• Compute your local updates sequentially for this problem set. We will explore parallelizing on-node in
the next problem set (using Kokkos).
• There are many famous patterns: blinkers, gliders, glider guns (they generate gliders), etc. The
emerging properties of the Game of Life are amazing; for instance, it has been proven to be a Turing
complete system, meaning any computer program can be coded in a sufficiently large Life world.
