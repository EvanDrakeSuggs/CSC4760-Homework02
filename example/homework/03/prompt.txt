Problem 3 (20pts/16pts):
Write a Kokkos program that creates and initializes a single dimensional View of non-trivial length (n >=
1000) with non-trival values (anything other default values, for example, V iew(i) = i ∗ i).
Then, create two additional Views of the same size and datatype.
2
Copy the first View into one of these using the Kokkos deep copy function. Copy another using the
Kokkos parallel for. Time each of these copy operations separately using Kokkos Timer and output the
results.
If different, consider how each of these are affected by the choice of backend. If roughly the same, what
does this mean for the backend.
